# Random Restart Hill Climbing


## Introduction

Random Restart Hill Climbing restarts hill climbing from random points to avoid local optima. \\

It combines hill climbing with random restarts, beginning the optimization process from different random starting points each time it gets stuck in a local optimum. This increases the likelihood of discovering the global optimum by exploring multiple regions of the search space. It balances exploration with the efficiency of hill climbing.
