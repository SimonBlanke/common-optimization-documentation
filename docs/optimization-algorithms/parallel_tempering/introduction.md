# Parallel Tempering


## Introduction

Parallel Tempering uses multiple simulated annealing instances at different temperatures to explore the search space. \\

It runs multiple instances of the optimization algorithm at different temperatures simultaneously. These instances periodically exchange information, allowing the system to explore more broadly while still exploiting local optima. It is particularly effective for complex landscapes with many local optima.
