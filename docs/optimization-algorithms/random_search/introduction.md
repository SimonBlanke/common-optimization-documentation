# Random Search


## Introduction

Random Search randomly samples the search space to find the best solution. \\

It relies on randomly selecting points in the search space and evaluating their fitness to find an optimal solution. This method is simple and easy to implement but can be inefficient for large or complex search spaces. It is often used as a baseline for comparing other optimization algorithms.
