# Lipschitz Optimizer


## Introduction

The Lipschitz Optimizer leverages Lipschitz continuity to bound the search space. \\

It uses the Lipschitz constant to estimate bounds on the objective function, thereby guiding the search process. It exploits the property that the function changes at a bounded rate, helping to efficiently narrow down the search area. This method is particularly useful for problems with known Lipschitz constants.
