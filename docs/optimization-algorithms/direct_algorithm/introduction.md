# Direct Algorithm


## Introduction

The Direct Algorithm, or DIviding RECTangles, partitions the search space adaptively to find optima. \\

It adaptively divides the search space into smaller hyper-rectangles and evaluates their potential to contain the optimum. It balances exploration and exploitation by focusing on promising regions. It is well-suited for global optimization of complex functions.
