# Pattern Search


## Introduction

Pattern Search explores the search space using a set of pattern moves. \\

It employs a strategy of exploring the search space by systematically testing points in a pattern around the current solution. It adjusts the pattern size based on the success of previous moves. This method is flexible and can be applied to various types of optimization problems without requiring gradient information.
