# Downhill Simplex Optimizer


## Introduction

The Downhill Simplex Optimizer, also known as the Nelder-Mead method, uses a geometric approach to explore the search space without needing gradient information. \\

It operates by forming a simplex of points and iteratively reflecting, expanding, and contracting it to explore the search space. It adapts to the local landscape to find minima. It is effective for continuous optimization problems and does not require gradient information.
