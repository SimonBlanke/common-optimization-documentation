## Introduction

Differential Evolution optimizes by combining the differences between solutions to explore the search space. \\

It generates new candidate solutions by adding the weighted difference between two population vectors to a third vector. This strategy encourages diversity and exploration while converging towards the optimum. It is particularly effective for continuous and multi-modal optimization problems.
