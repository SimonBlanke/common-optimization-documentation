## Introduction

Powell's Method is a direction-set optimization technique that does not require gradients. \\

It optimizes by performing line searches along a set of directions that are updated iteratively. It does not use derivatives and adjusts the direction vectors based on the performance of previous searches. It is particularly effective for problems where gradient information is unavailable or unreliable.
