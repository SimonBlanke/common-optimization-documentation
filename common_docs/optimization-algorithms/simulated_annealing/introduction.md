## Introduction

Simulated Annealing mimics the annealing process to find global optima by probabilistically accepting worse solutions. \\

It SimulatedAnnealingOptimizer employs a strategy inspired by the physical annealing process, where it explores the search space by accepting not only better solutions but also worse ones with a probability that decreases over time. This helps avoid local optima and improves the chances of finding the global optimum. The cooling schedule is crucial to its performance.
