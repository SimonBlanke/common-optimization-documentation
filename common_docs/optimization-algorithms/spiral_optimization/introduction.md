## Introduction

Spiral Optimization searches the space in a spiral pattern to find optima. \\

It employs a spiral trajectory to explore the search space, systematically expanding and contracting its search radius. This method combines deterministic exploration with adaptive step sizes to effectively navigate towards the optimum. It is particularly useful for problems where a systematic and thorough search is needed.
