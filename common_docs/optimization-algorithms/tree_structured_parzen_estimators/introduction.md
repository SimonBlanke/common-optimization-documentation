## Introduction

Tree Structured Parzen Estimators model the objective function using non-parametric density estimation. \\

It approachs optimization by modeling the objective function with tree-structured probabilistic models. It estimates the probability densities for good and bad solutions separately and samples new candidates accordingly. TPE is particularly effective for optimizing complex hyperparameter spaces.
