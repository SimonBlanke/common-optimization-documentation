## Introduction

Particle Swarm Optimizer simulates a group of particles to explore the search space collectively. \\

It models a population of particles that move through the search space influenced by their own experience and that of their neighbors. Each particle adjusts its trajectory based on personal best and global best positions, balancing exploration and exploitation. It is widely used for continuous optimization problems due to its simplicity and effectiveness.
