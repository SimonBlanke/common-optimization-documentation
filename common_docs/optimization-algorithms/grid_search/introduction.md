## Introduction

Grid Search systematically searches through a predefined grid of parameter values. \\

It involves defining a grid of potential parameter values and exhaustively evaluating each combination to find the best solution. It is straightforward and guarantees finding the optimum within the grid but can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional spaces. It is commonly used in hyperparameter tuning.
