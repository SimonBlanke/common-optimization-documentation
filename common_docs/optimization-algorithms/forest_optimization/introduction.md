# Forest Optimization


## Introduction

Forest Optimization uses tree-based ensembles to guide the optimization process. \\

It employs an ensemble of decision trees to model the objective function and predict promising regions in the search space. By leveraging the collective insights of multiple trees, it balances exploration and exploitation. This method is robust and effective for high-dimensional and complex optimization problems.
