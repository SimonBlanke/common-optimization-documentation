## Introduction

Repulsing Hill Climbing modifies hill climbing by incorporating a repulsion mechanism to avoid local optima. \\

It enhances the basic hill climbing approach by adding a repulsion mechanism that discourages returning to recently visited solutions. This helps to navigate out of local optima and explore new areas of the search space. It aims for a more comprehensive search compared to standard hill climbing.
