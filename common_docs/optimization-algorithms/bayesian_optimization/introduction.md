## Introduction

Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to guide the search for the optimum.

It builds a probabilistic model of the objective function and uses it to select promising points to evaluate. It balances exploration and exploitation by considering both the predicted mean and uncertainty of the model. This method is efficient for expensive-to-evaluate functions and is widely used in hyperparameter tuning.
