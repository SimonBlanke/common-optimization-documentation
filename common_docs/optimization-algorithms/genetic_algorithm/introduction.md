## Introduction

Genetic Algorithm uses evolutionary strategies to optimize by simulating natural selection. \\

It mimics the process of natural evolution, using operations such as selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve a population of solutions. It iteratively improves the solutions by combining and modifying them, promoting diversity and exploration. This method is versatile and effective for a wide range of optimization problems.
