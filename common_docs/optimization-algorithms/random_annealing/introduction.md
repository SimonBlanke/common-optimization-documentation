## Introduction

Random Annealing combines random search with annealing-like strategies. \\

It integrates random search methods with principles from simulated annealing to probabilistically accept both better and worse solutions. This hybrid approach enhances the ability to escape local optima while retaining the simplicity of random search. It is designed to improve robustness in finding global optima.
