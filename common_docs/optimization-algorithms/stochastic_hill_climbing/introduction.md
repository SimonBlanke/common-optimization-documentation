## Introduction

Stochastic Hill Climbing introduces randomness into the hill climbing process to escape local optima. \\

It adds a stochastic element to the traditional hill climbing algorithm by occasionally accepting worse solutions to escape local maxima. This randomness helps in exploring the search space more broadly. It balances exploration and exploitation to improve the chances of finding the global optimum.
