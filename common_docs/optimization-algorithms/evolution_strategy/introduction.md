## Introduction

Evolution Strategy uses evolutionary strategies to optimize by simulating natural selection. \\

It is an evolutionary algorithm that emphasizes mutation and selection processes to evolve solutions. It adapts the mutation rates and selection pressures based on the performance of previous generations, allowing for dynamic and flexible optimization. It is well-suited for complex, high-dimensional optimization problems.
